/* Inspired by Stefan Blom's test case fwd.sil, this test boils down to lots of
 * inhales and exhales of quantified permissions (over sequences) to the same
 * field. Hence, the permission terms stored in the quantified chunks grow
 * exponentially in the worst case.
 *
 * The test is meant to stress-test both the verifier's and the prover's
 * performance. For example, Silicon could grind to a halt because the
 * permission terms got so large that it essentially could no longer emit them
 * to Z3. If the permission terms get emitted, then Z3 still has to do quite
 * some work to discharge the proof obligations in which these terms occur, for
 * example, that sufficiently many permissions are available.
