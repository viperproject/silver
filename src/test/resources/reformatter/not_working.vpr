// This test demonstrates three code snippets which are (to the best of my
// knowledge) the only very big limitations to the current version of the
// formatter, and unfortunately fixing them is very difficult with the current
// architecture of the reformatter, since we have limited flexibility due to the
// fact that we rely on `PrettyPrintPrimitives` instead of having a hand-written
// reformatter.

method test1() {
    // Problem 1: The side comment will be pushed to the next line.
    // The reason for this is that we separate variables with a newline by
    // default, and since the newline will be added before adding the trivia,
    // the newline will be added before the comment, and thus move to the next
    // line.
    var a: Int := 1; // A side comment
    // Problem 2: The 4 in the next line will not be indented.
    var b: Int := 2 + // Another comment
    4
}

// Problem 3: Trailing comments might not be indented correctly.
// In this case, since we always attach the trivia to the next node below
// (the closing bracket in this case), it will also be subject to the indentation
// of that node.
