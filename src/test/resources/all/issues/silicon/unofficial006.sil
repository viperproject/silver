/* Silver commit 5b89574 uncovered a bug in Silicon, namely, that locals
 * declared inside while-loops were not added to Silicon's store.
 * This didn't cause any existing test case to fail, though, because those
 * local variables were nevertheless declared if they were written to inside
 * the loop body - which was the case in all our tests.
