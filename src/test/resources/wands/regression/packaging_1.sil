In the transfer of acc(x.f,1/2) in the packaging ghost operation we learn that x.f is 2 in the current state but that information can generally only be used until the packaging ghost operation is finished executing. So in the current version of Carbon (23.08) that fact won't be available when transferring acc(x.f,1/4), hence it doesn't verify currently in Carbon.
