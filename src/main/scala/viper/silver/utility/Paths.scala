        // 2013-05-03 Malte:
        // The following bit of code is quite nasty, but I wasn't able to get anything less
        // nasty to work reliably. There are two main problems:
        //
        // 1. It is not obvious when to close the file system, because several components of
        //    our tool chain keep references to path objects that in turn have references
        //    to their underlying file system. If these path objects are used (not all usages
        //    seem dangerous, though) after the underlying file system has been closed, an
        //    exception is thrown.
        //
        // 2. If the test suite is executed from an Sbt prompt then the shutdown hook of
        //    the runtime environment doesn't seem to fire and the file systems don't seem
        //    to be closed. Thus, if the tests are executed again without existing the
        //    Sbt prompt, FileSystemAlreadyExistsExceptions can be thrown because some
        //    file systems are still open.
        //
        // The list of open file systems (openFileSystems) unfortunately doesn't seem to
        // survive, otherwise it might have been possible to maintain a map from file URI
        // to file system and only create a new file system if there is no map entry for
        // the given file URI yet.
        //
        // I also tried to use a finalizer method instead of the shutdown hook, but the
        // finalizer also doesn't seem to be called if the Sbt prompt is not existed.
