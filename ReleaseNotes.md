## Release 2022.7

**Date 29/07/22**

### Changes in Viper Language

- ADT plugin added. It is enabled by default, and can be disabled with the `--disableAdtPlugin` command-line option. This plugin converts ADT (abstract datatype) declarations of the form `adt (name) { Constructor1(args) ... }` into domain types with constructors, destructors, discriminants, and corresponding axioms. More information can be found in [the tutorial](https://viper.ethz.ch/tutorial/#adt-plugin) ([Silver#574](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/574))
- Added support for a `refute (expression)` statement. This statement behaves like an assertion, except the expression is expected to be provably false. More information can be found in [the tutorial](https://viper.ethz.ch/tutorial/#assertion-checking) ([Silver#583](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/583))
- Division of two `Perm`-typed expressions is now allowed. ([Silver#572](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/572))
- Typed function application syntax (`(foo(...) : T)`) now parses properly. ([Silver#584](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/584))

### Backend-specific upgrades/changes

#### Symbolic Execution Verifier (Silicon)

- Output sent to the backend solver is now SMT-LIB 2.6 conformant. Additionally, there is experimental support for the CVC5 solver using the `--prover cvc5` command-line option. ([Silicon#609](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/609))
- Improved counterexamples. Counterexamples are now generated for domain types as well, and are included in the output with the `--counterexample mapped` command-line option. ([Silicon#631](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/631))

#### Verification Condition Generation Verifier (Carbon)

- **Breaking change**: wildcard `acc` expressions in `exhale` statements are no longer reordered. Behaviour is now consistent with Silicon and all permissions in an `exhale` statement are always exhaled left to right. ([Silicon#30](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/issues/30), [Carbon#411](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/pull/411))

### Miscellaneous

- "Chopper" API is now available to front ends. This functionality allows a single Viper file to be split into multiple smaller files that can be verified separately. Dependencies between functions, methods, and predicates are correctly determined to minimise the size of the individual Viper files. ([Silver#589](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/589))
- Upgraded projects to use `sbt` version 1.6.2. ([Silicon#627](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/627), [Silver#592](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/592))
- Viper IDE uses `.vpr` as its default file extension. ([viper-ide#223](https://github.com/viperproject/viper-ide/pull/223))
- Viper IDE now requires at least Java version 11. ([viper-ide#250](https://github.com/viperproject/viper-ide/pull/250))
- Cache improvements. ([Silver#578](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/578))
- Various bug fixes. ([Carbon#423](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/pull/423), [Carbon#425](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/pull/425), [viper-ide#248](https://github.com/viperproject/viper-ide/pull/248), [Silver#496](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/issues/496), [Silver#587](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/587), [Silver#590](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/590))

## Release 2022.2

**Date 28/02/22**

### Changes in Viper Language

- **Breaking change**: As mentioned in the release notes for 2021.7, starting with the 2022.2 release, Viper will check injectivity of inhaled quantified permissions by default, instead of assuming it. In the previous release, this feature was enabled with the `--checkInjectivity` flag. It is now enabled by default and can instead by disabled with the `--assumeInjectivityOnInhale` flag. This change makes the injectivity requirement consistent with other well-definedness conditions in Viper (such as ruling out potential division by zero).

### Backend-specific upgrades/changes

#### Symbolic Execution Verifier (Silicon)

- Added new option to report multiple errors per path, potentially allowing verification to continue beyond a failing pure condition (e.g. assert statement). The command-line argument `--numberOfErrorsToReport` (by default 1, 0 indicates all errors are to be reported) controls how many errors will be reported by the verifier before it stops. ([Silicon#575](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/575))
- Added new option to report branch conditions in errors using the command-line argument `--enableBranchconditionReporting`. When enabled, errors reported on the command line additionally show a list of conditions or their negations that were reached on the path to the error. ([Silicon#575](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/575))
- Fixed a memory leak ([Silicon#579](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/issues/579)).
- When Z3 quantifier reporting is enabled (for example, by passing `--z3Args '"smt.qi.profile=true smt.qi.profile_freq=10000"'` to Silicon), its output is now recognised and printed in Silicon's output, to enable a quick check for likely matching loops. ([Silicon#587](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/587))
- Removed magic-wand-related heuristics described in ECOOPâ€™15 (these were not generally enabled for standard Viper input files). ([Silicon#589](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/589))
Bug fixes. ([Silicon#582](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/issues/582), [Silicon#583](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/583), [Silicon#584](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/584))

#### Verification Condition Generation Verifier (Carbon)

- Check that predicate bodies are self-framing. ([Carbon#397](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/pull/397/))
- Bug fixes. ([Carbon#398](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/pull/398/))

### Miscellaneous

- CI workflows for Viper tools migrated to GitHub actions.
- Silver AST can now represent all SMT-LIB bitvector functions, although these are not yet supported in the language. ([Silver#537](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/537/))
- Impure assumes rewriter fix. ([Silver#553](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/553/))
- Viper IDE cache can be stored to a file. ([ViperServer#44](https://github.com/viperproject/viperserver/pull/44/))
- Position information fix. ([Silver#555](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/555/))

## Release 2021.7
#### Date 27/07/21     [Download](http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper/downloads.html)

### Changes in Viper Language

* **Breaking change**: Inhaling possibly-negative permission amounts now leads to a verification failure, whereas in previous releases it led to an inconsistent state [(Silver, 522)](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/issues/522). For example, `inhale acc(x.f, e)` for some permission expression `e` will now cause a *failure* if `e` is not known to be non-negative, rather than implicitly assuming this property.
* **Planned future breaking change**: Currently, Viper checks the [injectivity of the receiver expression when exhaling quantified permissions](http://viper.ethz.ch/tutorial/?page=1&section=#receiver-expressions-and-injectivity), but not when inhaling quantified permissions (when this property is currently *assumed*). We [plan to change this](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/issues/531) in the January 2022 release, that is Viper will also check injectivity is known when inhaling quantified permissions. Since this is an important breaking change, we have provided access to it in *this* release but only if the `--checkInjectivity` flag is provided. This flag will be removed in the next release, and the corresponding injectivity checks will be enabled by default.

### Backend-specific upgrades/changes

#### Symbolic Execution Verifier (Silicon)
* Added new option for displaying counterexamples using the `--counterexample mapped` command-line argument. This option produces pretty-printed counterexamples with heap chunks resolved to their contained fields.
* Added a [new option](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/blob/master/src/main/scala/Config.scala#L456) for selecting different [state consolidation modes](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/blob/master/src/main/scala/Config.scala#L597) affecting how complete, and thus expensive, a state consolidation is [experimental]
* Added scope-based logging of symbolic execution details ([PR #562](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/pull/562))


#### Verification Condition Generation Verifier (Carbon)

* Fixed labelled old expressions that potentially refer to labels that have not yet been defined [(Carbon, PR 387)](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/pull/387)
* Added support for loops formed via gotos  [(Carbon, PR 389)](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/pull/389)
* Minor bug fixes ([382](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/issues/382), [386](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/pull/386))

### Miscellaneous

#### Viper-IDE & ViperServer
* Compatibility with latest versions of Silicon and Carbon incl. latest Viper features (e.g. `Map` types and anonymous axioms).
* Mono is no longer a requirement.
* The JAVA installation has to be version 11 or higher and must be 64-bit.
* The IDE now shows non-critical warning messages. 
* Build version of Viper Tools (i.e. the dependencies) can be configured in the VSCode settings:
  * `Stable` / `Nightly`: the latest Viper Tools in the corresponding build configuration will be used. The [Preferences](https://github.com/viperproject/viper-ide/wiki/Settings:-Preferences) specify from which URL the Viper Tools will be downloaded. The Viper Tools are not automatically updated. They only get installed when they are not present yet or when a manual update is triggered (via the command palette). The installation folder has changed for these two build versions: They always get installed to `<VSCode Installation>/User/globalStorage/viper-admin.viper` where `<VSCode Installation>` corresponds to `~/Library/Application Support/Code` (on macOS), `c:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Code` (on Windows), and `~/.config/Code` (on Linux).
  * `Local`: uses the Viper Tools located at the path specified as `viperSettings.paths.viperToolsPath`.
* Locating the JAVA installation has been improved. A warning appears if it cannot be uniquely identified. A fixed path to a Java installation can be provided in the settings as `viperSettings.javaSettings.javaBinary` ([more details](https://github.com/viperproject/viper-ide/wiki/Settings:-Java-Settings)).
* Sound effects for a successful or failed verification can be enabled by setting `viperSettings.preferences.enableSoundEffects` to true.
* Minor bug fixes ([#23](https://github.com/viperproject/viperserver/issues/23))

## Release 2021.1
#### Date 15/02/21     [Download](http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper/downloads.html)

### Changes in Viper Language
* Basic support for partial maps. The associated keywords *domain* and *range* are experimental. Please report any observed incompletenesses w.r.t. map reasoning.

### Optimizations
* Optimized parser for large Viper files [(Silver, 477)](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/477).

### Viper Language API changes:
* **Breaking change**: New Scala (2.13.4) and fastparse version.
* **Breaking change**: The constructor of DomainFuncApp now requires that the function's return type is passed as for standard function applications (and not using call-by-name as before) [(Silver, 490)](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/490).
* Due to the deprecation of the Traversable trait, the Node class now extends the Iterable trait instead. The interface is similar, but the implementation of some methods like *find* and *exists* is less efficient because it internally creates a collection with all the elements on which to iterate over ([Silver, 493](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/493) and [Silver, 497](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/497)).
* New backend support for SMTLib types on the AST-level (particularly bitvectors and floats) [(Silver, 428)](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/pull/428).
* Magic wands used inside predicate definitions of function preconditions generate errors (these usages were never fully supported, but a clear error wasnâ€™t shown). We hope to add support for these cases in future.

### Backend-specific upgrades/changes

* [Symbolic Execution Verifier](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silicon/)
  * Several minor bugfixes.
  * Two permission-related incompleteness fixed: [(Silicon, 512)](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/issues/512) and [(Silicon, 508)](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/issues/508).
  * Command-line option for avoiding creation of a local temp directory [(Silicon, 15)](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/issues/15).

* [Verification Condition Generation Verifier](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/)
  * Boogie upgrade: Boogie is now built with .NET Core and is shipped with all dependencies. As a result, Mono is not required anymore for Boogie on Linux.
  * Minor fixes
    * Boogie AST changed to support unnamed parameters in domain functions [(Carbon, 363)](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/issues/363).
    * Fix negative fraction check in quantified permissions [(Carbon, 362)](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/issues/362).

### Miscellaneous
* The Viper IDE (VSCode extension) cannot yet use the new Boogie version, and thus will continue to use the 2020.7 release.
* Viper performs worse with Z3 4.8.9 than with 4.8.6, thus we recommend the use of Z3 4.8.6.

## Release 2020.7
#### Date 17/07/20     [Download](http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper/downloads.html)
##### Our repositories are now on GitHub: [github.com/viperproject](https://github.com/viperproject)

### Changes in Viper Language
* Axiom names are now optional [(Silver, 193)](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/issues/193).
For example, we now allow domains such as:
	```
    domain MyDomain {
      function foo(): Int

      axiom  { foo() > 2 }
      axiom  upperlimit { foo() < 8 }
    }
	```
* Experimental support for **termination checks** [tutorial section about termination](http://viper.ethz.ch/tutorial/#termination).
  * This extension provides support for specifying termination measures for heap-dependent functions and using them to prove termination.
  * There is also support for proving termination of methods and loops, but those are still experimental and support for these features as well as the semantics of the specifications might change.
  * Details are explained in the Viper tutorial.
* Experimental support for **counter examples**:
  * Added the command line option `--counterexample`. When using either backend with `--counterexamples=variables`, it will return, along with each verification error, a counter example for the values of all local variables (but not the heap or functions) on the Viper level. Alternatively, using the option `--counterexample=native` will return a backend-specific counter example along with each error that contains the entire model exactly as returned by the SMT solver, i.e., including any renaming and encoding the backends may have performed.

### Bug fixes
* 64-bit Z3 is now shipped with the Windows distribution (the 32-bit version which was inadvertently still being shipped can cause memory issues for some examples) [(Silicon, 375)](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/issues/375)
* Intermittent Failures on Viper Online (web interface) should no longer happen (but for now we only support the default backend) [(Silver, 264)](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/issues/264)
* Reserved words are declared in only one place in the codebase [(Silver, 301)](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/issues/301)
* The phases used to organise programmatically calling verifiers (frontends, in the codebase) have been made more consistent and flexible [(Silver, 270)](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/issues/270)
* Several examples which had long runtimes are now apparently stable (but we would appreciate any feedback to the contrary!). e.g. [(Silver, 457)](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/issues/457)


### Viper Language API changes:
* The `DomainAxiom` AST node no longer exists, it was replaced by:
  * `NamedDomainAxiom`, providing exactly the same features as `DomainAxiom`.
  * `AnonymousDomainAxiom`, which is similar to the node above except for the absence of the `name` parameter.

### Backend-specific upgrades/changes

* [Symbolic Execution Verifier](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silicon/)
  * More-complete aliasing properties can be deduced in programs using quantified permissions [(Silicon, 502)](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/issues/502)
  * Potential crash removed when using quantifiers and unfolding expressions in a function body [(Silicon, 491)](https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/issues/491)

* [Verification Condition Generation Verifier](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/)
  * Axioms used for sequence operations should be more complete (especially for cases such as dropping more elements than a sequence has) [(Carbon, 36)](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/issues/36)
  * Sequence contains function now works in triggers [(Carbon, 349)](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/issues/349)
  * Carbon should now kill child Boogie and Z3 processes eagerly on stop(); this behaviour may be setup-dependent so please report any outstanding issues [(Carbon, 225)](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/issues/225)
  * Predicates whose parameters include bound variables (e.g. from outer-quantifiers) now work in function specifications [(Carbon, 271)](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/issues/271)
  * Work in progress on correct handling of perm-expressions inside unfolding expressions / quantifiers: some issues have been fixed; a summary of the current status is provided [(Carbon, 348)](https://github.com/viperproject/carbon/issues/348)

---

## Release 2020.1
#### Date 31/01/20     [Download](http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper/downloads.html)

### Changes in Viper Language
* Support for variable scopes. For example, now it is possible
to define two variables with the same name in different branches:
    ```
	if (b) {
        var x: Int := 5;
    } else {
        var x: Bool := true;
    }
	```
* Added support for using field lookups and predicates as triggers, e.g.
    ```
	forall r: Ref :: {r.f} r in s ==> r.f > 0

    forall r: Ref :: {P(r)} r in s ==> (unfolding P(r) in r.f > 0)
	```
    Note: this support still has some [issues](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/issues/257) in Viper's VCG-based verifier.

* Added support for trigger annotations on existential quantifiers. These are written and behave analogously to those already supported on forall quantifiers, and are relevant in the logically dual cases, typically when *proving* an existentially-quantified assertion [(189)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/189).
* Extended support for Viper plugins (designed to make lightweight Viper front-end tools simple to write). In particular, extending the grammar of the parser via plugins is now possible.
* Removed the experimental built-in function termination checking. An experimental
termination plugin is available: https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/termination-plugin/
Feedback is welcome; we plan support for termination checking in the next release.
* Renamed all example files from .sil to .vpr [(287)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/287).
* The unary plus operator has been removed [(108)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/271).
* Whitespace between unary operations and their operands is no-longer allowed [(272)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/272).
* The `fresh` statement was removed [(87)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/87).
* Macros can now take field names as parameters [(170)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/170).
* LHS of field assignment statements can now be a macro invocation [(214)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/214).
* Warnings are now generated for unused macro parameters [(267)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/267).
* Macro definitions are disallowed inside magic wand proof scripts [(215)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/215).

### Bug fixes
* Conditional assertions as part of quantified permissions are properly supported, e.g. 
  `inhale forall j : Int :: (j == k ? acc(s.f) : true)` [(260)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/260).
* Expression macros with missing bodies no-longer cause spurious parser errors (for next construct) [(273)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/273).
* `new(..)` parameterised by identifiers which are present in the program but are not field names now produces an appropriate error message [(247)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/247).
* Type checker no longer crashes on ASTs with sharing [(191)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/191).
* Macro names are now checked for clashes [(167)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/167).
* The AST utility method `Expressions.instantiateVariables` is now capture-avoiding (an additional parameter can be provided to exclude certain names from being chosen when renaming bound variables) [(286)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/286).
* Eliminated spurious type error involving #E type when using empty Multisets via macros [(282)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/282).
* AST transformation framework's Rewritable is no-longer limited w.r.t. collections of Rewritables [(225)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/225).

### Viper Language API changes: 
* `LocalVar` AST node no longer has type as an optional field [(281)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/281).
* `Result` AST node no longer has type in its second parameter list [(283)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/283).
* `Call` trait, `FuncApp` and `DomainFuncApp` AST nodes no longer have a `formalArgs` field; this information can be obtained from the enclosing `Program` [(241)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver/issues/241).
* Upgraded all dependencies, libraries, plugins and development environment:
    * SBT 1.2.6, rewriting all build files.
	* Scala 2.12.7
	* fastparse	1.0.0
	* ScalaTest 3.0.5.
	* scallop 3.1.3.
	* jgrapht-core 1.2.0.
	* scala-parser-combinators 1.1.1.
	* commons-io 2.6.
	* guava 26.0.
	* slf4j-api 1.7.25.
	* logback-classic 1.2.3.
	* scala-logging 3.9.0
	* sbt-assembly 0.14.7
	* sbteclipse-plugin	5.2.4.
  

### Backend-specific upgrades/changes
* [Symbolic Execution Verifier](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silicon/)
    * Implemented an experimental feature that allows using the quantified
permissions based handling of permissions for all permissions. This
handling of permissions is expected to be more complete and may be faster;
however, the implementation is still in beta state. The feature can be
enabled with the ``--enableMoreCompleteExhale`` flag.
    * (API) Uses logback library instead of log4j for logging.
    * (API) Changed how the verifier reports errors: introduced a reporter class
that is responsible for reporting errors to the user (before errors were
reported via logging). Verification results of a particular method are
reported via the reporter as soon as they become available without
waiting for all methods to be verified.
* [Verification Condition Generation Verifier](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/)
    * Quantified permissions with multiple forall-bound variables are now supported [(205)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/issues/205/).
    * Experimental adjustments to the background axioms used for set, sequence and multiset support. These should   mostly add completeness; fewer scenarios should require user assertions to verify. Please report any bugs observed (particularly examples which exhibit poorer performance). In the next release, this will be stabilised, and migrated analogously to Viper's Symbolic Execution back-end. 
    * Old expressions in triggers are now translated correctly [(236)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/issues/236/).
    * Substitution of actuals for formals in method specifications, predicate unfoldings and function preconditions is now capture-avoiding [(262)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/issues/262), [(282)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/issues/282).
    * Quantified predicates without arguments no-longer cause a crash [(279)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/issues/279).

### Other Notes
   * We observed that 'Out of memory' errors can occur for some larger examples if using a 32-bit (rather than 64-bit) version of Z3 [(286)](https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/carbon/issues/286). We recommend always using a 64-bit version.
